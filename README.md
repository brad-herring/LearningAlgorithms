# NFLCombineClassifier
Machine learning classification algorithm using tensorflow.

Topics covered in this project:
- Data examination and cleaning using Excel
- Classification using tensorflow DNN
- Excel data interactions with Pandas
- Numpy data cleaning to remove data points with values of zero
- Replacement of categorical data with numerical data
- Data preprocessing with Scikit-Learn and Pandas to obtain standardized data
- Evaluation of model accuracy
- Hidden layer/node (hyperparameter) manipulation to tune the model
- Making predictions using user input
- Evaluating prediction accuracy

Possible future updates:
- Edit user input script to accept origial data before preprocessing
- Further clean the data by eliminating several positions
- Use feature importance techniques to uncover useful information
- Split the training and testing data into chunks of the original data
